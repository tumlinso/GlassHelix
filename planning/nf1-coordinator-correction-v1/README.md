# NF1 coordinator queue correction

The accepted initial plan queued epic `GH-NF1-0000` as the only coordinator task. The installed claim engine excludes an epic until its children complete, preventing acquisition of the coordinator seat needed to execute them.

This schema-3 maintenance delta adds `GH-NF1-COORD` as a normal child task and places it before the unchanged epic in `GH-NF1-L-COORD`. The existing run, charter, root, lane role, workspace mode, implementation queues, gates, interfaces and cross-project closure order are preserved. No source capability is marked complete. The coordinator finishes after local M90 and before epic closure.

Apply only through supported transactional plan administration following a fresh validation/diff. The user explicitly authorized this correction and related routine repairs on 2026-09-09. This is an additive correction to the sealed original delivery, not a replacement task database.

The coordinator task reserves a project-local named seat lock, satisfying parallel-safe scope admission without claiming production paths. Reapplying a queue correction while a lane is active is not a recovery procedure.

## Integration destination correction

`integrator.todo-plan.json` changes only the unprovisioned local L-M lane from isolated_merge to exclusive, as required for the destination of the existing native integration queue. It preserves task queues explicitly in lane context and does not replay implementation task definitions. Source Todo maintenance commit `c8592c5fffdb5c882f66c593d9a31206edb209ad` permits this guarded schema-3 amendment only when lane identity is unchanged and no active work or workspace exists. The installed execution runtime already supports the resulting mode; no service restart or runtime file edit is required.

T01 runtime qualification now has an external per-workspace bindings path. The `t01-gate.todo-plan.json` delta was reconstructed from live declarations and simulated against a restored native export; only the pending T01 gate environment changes. `t01-gate-review.json` records the preservation comparison and applied revision. Source must be committed, rebuilt in that dispatched workspace, and checked against CMake home before a capability receipt is consumed.

The B01 build owner now has a narrow root `CMakeLists.txt` scope transfer, ordered before later integration and after its prerequisites. This allows actual source-linked targets and named test registration without an empty CTest dependency. The native B01 task brief was republished with that scope. B01 and the CE N01 gate use external per-workspace bindings; all other simulated semantics are preserved.
